Unraveling the Prison Complex System:

Case Study Cobb County, Georgia

It is widely known that the systems at play are comprised of an elite that run our systems that keep the wealthy rich, and the disenfranchised, indigents, minorities, disabled or otherwise disadavantaged groups in the notoriously known "prison complex system".

But, how is it that this system hasn't been unhinged? Where are the roots of the system, and how can we begin to unveil its problems?

I came across this problem, this answer and this "complex" in my own life, and that is how all of this unfolds.

I am a happy working single mom, writer, creative and Latina living with PTSD, just outside the Metro Atlanta area, in the suburbs of Cobb County, Georgia.

I had suffered a series of traumatizing events in my house, working on a story about how Women of Color could, potentially, completely change the Vote. I started writing it, on this platform, celebrating equality, our feminist spirits, women of color of all sexual orientation, the x factor, an all inclusive magazine. The time and year, not so suprising, before primary elections in a highly contentions political arena, and one in which racism and sexism where center stage in the Spring of 2016\.

And just like that, is when my own personal Hell broke lose.

Internet went down, alarm going of, I was drugged and abused in my own home. Almost the perfect crime... except for one thing. It all led to my losing my house, my life, my child to the corruption of the Cobb County Superior Court system.

How this happened, in not quite sure but the reasons why aren't that far fetched.

I lived in a house that had a large reserve behind it. Wide open woods, with access from various areas in which, after taking a few hikes wondering out on my own, I found could be accessible to nearly anyone that so had the wish or will to do so. Public property, no restrictions of access.

I lost my shit. I had a nervous breakdown as all these events began to happen, leading me straight down the narrow path of the Cobb County Courts -- in defense of my basic human rights, as it now is clearly presented.

I was summoned in to court, with less than 24 hour notice, in a ill comprised summons package, no complaint, no petition, no real understanding of what the fuck what going on.

I'm hastily shoved into a Court room, Judge Stoddard preciding. Everyone was nice, cool, no feeling of conflict, except my own interruptions and pleas for counsel, so that I could " do whats best for my son".

The Judge wanted me to sign an order, giving custody to my ex of my child, at which time, in a complete neurosis of my own, I pled only for legal representation about 4 times that I can recall. No, no, my pleas ignored. The Judge said in order for my son to stay at my ex's house, in which I didn't want my child to be at, I would have to sign my son away to a man, which I now had started just to understand, was sexually abusive with my child. My little boy was only eight years old, and I completely unknowing of what to do. I had my job security taken from my family, terrorized at my house, and now facing the loss of my child.

It wasn't until a few months later that I discovered the original petition, in the form of a complaint, that the Court had considired for the initial Emergency Hearing. No petition for Legitimization, no actual notice of what matter of the hearing were for.

Now, not only is a Legitimization not supposed to be in an Emergency Hearing, as my summons would have it, but all issues of custoy should be in a separate hearing, as the current Rules for Legitimazation have in Cobb County.

As a disabled, as indigent, and as a minor, my son and I both have been hugely neglected our rights to an attorney in such a hearing. It should have run concurrent to Juveniel court, safeguarding my child's welfare, allowing for CASA to be accesible (public program for these mattters), counsel, and oversight. OCGA 15 -- all of it was neglected. Juvenile laws.

But wait, there's more.

Rules of Evidence? None in play. Inadmissable hearsay, slander and libel, at best, is what they had, none of which was ever presented to me.

Due process? What's that? None afforded to me.

Infucciency of process, improper venue, every single fundamental right stripped of me. Lack of jurisdictional subject matter. Every single Constitutional Right, Civil Right, Human and Ethic rights, stand before me and not with me, in civl Case \# 16-1-5754-52\.

Five days after this preposterous hearing, I was found in so-called "Contempt", for picking my son up from school. Even if, we were to argue that the initial order even had a leg to stand on, the Contempt hearing should have been given to me with a 30 day notice, and there was no contempt, as I still had, under the Courts eyes, joing legal custody of my child. So why was I in contempt? Why was I detained at the airport, in the arrivals area, waiting for my friend, in federal jurisdiction two counties away? That explanation was never given, and the Courts of Cobb County felt somehow, that they didn't owe me one.

I was handcuffed, they made my child turnaround and watch. I pled for them to explain to me, why?, I warned them of my Miranda Rights. They were two men, at least 250 lbs., 6'4" -- they picked me up with my feet dangling in the air, injuring my shoulder, dislocating it at the rotator cuff.

The day was August, but the dates don't add up. The first day of school that year was August 1\. The hearing was scheduled for August 2, as the summons arrived only that afternoon, the first day of school. I remember clearly, it was an arduous day, my son at my ex's and he was alienating my child, and my mother helping in all of this, helping my ex take my son away? It's like a sick joke, one which I wouldn't even wish on my worse enemy, yet alone a child of mine? Evil mother, evil ex, evil Court system. As I sit looking pretty on this amazing platform I built on my own, everyone questioning my integrity? What for? Where's the fruit of your work? Let's play. What have you to show for yourself? Nada. Me? Everything! But, I digress.

Arrivng at the Sheriff's of Cobb County, I was shoved in to solitary confinement. 36 hours later, I was given only threats if I didn't take a vaccine shot, one which I told the nurse was against my religious beliefs, to which she responded- she would put me back in the cell without being processed, and not in the sytem.... Did I want that? Vaccine, or solitary confinement? I had to pick my evil, which one? I was pleading, why am I here? Miranda rights? I have warned you. Now you know, I have told you that you have not afforded me my rights, and I told every single motherfucker in there. They laughed at me, calling me Alicia Silverstone? Yea, well fuck you too, assholes. I warned you.

But my case docket is confusing. The contempt or order is filed as consent order, the dates make no sense, somewhere in there it implies I was IN jail, IN custody, when the custody, not contempt hearing was set. I'm so confused, and the more the cover-up the more they just show their corruptions.

Now where was I. Ah, yes. Was it a TB shot or tetanus shot? One of the two, it stung, I complained, the nurse threatened me with more isolation in the cell.

I was delayed again for my lack of answering all their questions, but not once did they answer mine. Why am I here? My Miranda Rights? If I'm in handcuffs in jail, then I have a right to an attorney. How dare you treat me like a criminal but afford me no rights, treating the case like a civil case. But still, any residual rights, parental rights, or any matter where a minor child's rights are "substancially affected", a Guardian At Litem is always appointed. In a hearing before Judge Poole on December 1st, I requested a GAL.

â‰ˆ

> "Not at this Court's expense"... "Do you have $3,500?" 

He looks at me, and then Dennis. To which we both responded no.

He said he was treating this like a divorce case. When I asked why the contempt order, why was I having to defend myself for my basic rights? His response, to which I will never forget.

> "That ship has sailed"

What ship? It's the same case file?! I'm baffled, there looking at him as if the only person with one shred of understanding was me, that the injustice was so profuse, so obvious, that he didn't allow me Christmas with my child. No card, no call, no gift. There was no restraining order at that time, just some illogical no contact order in a contempt hearing, filed under Custody hearing. Yes, that's how confusing the issue is, that's how much they simply keep the powers at play, the disenfranchised weak. Little did he, nor they know, what a mother's will is, what one single girl can do. They underestimated what I would do, in order to establish one thing and one thing only. Justice.

Now, looking at my notes, the papers from jail said it was August 9th, but the date was August 13th and the contempt order (consent to them?) shows October 4, 2016\. The hearing transaction records shows incorrect information and illegal process.

8/1/2016 Kreeger shows "No service" "OFF".

8/2/2016 Kreeger shows "Consent" order (not contempt)

8/12/2016 Stoddars shows "Order granted" "Father has sole custody"

This is the mess I'm faced with. None of that is how it happened!

I tried on several attempt to show my "diagnosis, treatment and treatment plan" with clear and convincing, or clear and compelling evidence was it? Either way, it left it soley at the judge's discretion, to which presenting to them a CLEAR case (to the average person) of diagnosis, treatment and treatment plan. PTSD was clearly present, and the only reason I was in distress was due to the Court's order, the last time I submitted anything. That was ignored, again. My rights to see my child keep getting pushed aside, and my case now, not being heard.

So I had to do what I had to do.

I answered, and complained.

Judges should have:

Compelled Discovery

Notified nature of hearing bearing protective order

Given my child a GAL

Given me a right to confront testimony

Produced testimony to me

Right to contest

If order was given in which no response was given within 30 days, then a copy of said interrogatory, should be quoted verbatim. But there was no interrogatory.

Finding of facts and any evidence relied upon to make determination

Right to cross-examine

Court shall "state facts" upon which the continued custody is based

Set a comprehensive plan

Reserved any matter of custody for hearing seperate from Legitmization

No Legitimization packed, no petition

Set time frame within legal parameters under Juvenile courts

Provided indigent and disabled rights

I was denied

Due process

Proper service

Proper notification

Denied access to facts which impacted my fundamental rights

Denied proper plan

Denied remedy

No complaint in which relief can be sought

Judges had

Lack of jurisdictional powers, in subject matter, in hearing which modified and order, in federal airport jurisdiction

Conflict of interest, why was I being heard with a drug court Judge? Alternative courts, they get $9,000, so they NEEDED me to be in the alternative court, and keeping me IN drug court is how they thought the could keep me there... where's this so-called "evidence" that drugs was an issue? I showed my medication prescription, I went an received a second opinion in the Court's same agency they refer people to, and had the same presciption prescribed, after my third assesment, treatment plan and treatment. Mind you, the last being a Court agency. I had to make sure no stone went unturned.

Civil Court Procedure Rules

Rule 5.5 Privilage of information, witheld.

Rule 6.2 Reply, unless otherwise ordered (which it was not)

Rule 6.3 All motions shall be decided by oral hearing EXCEPT motions not withstanding verdict. So if we apply this, then why do I have to present evidence? But this matter should have been in writing, as stipulated in its' own rules.

Rule 6.4 Failure to make discovery and Motion to Compel Discovery

OCGA 9.11.37

(A)(i) Quote verbatim or copy AS AN EXHIBIT each interrogatory to which no response or insufficiency of reponse is provided.

Letters, improperly entered, inadmissable and slanderous, nor provided to Defendant were used as "instruments of authenticy and guarantee of facts"

Ruling were made on judges right to informal adjutication, might be argument. But facts show that there were clear laws that precluded the judge's decisions, therefore the rulings do not stand.
