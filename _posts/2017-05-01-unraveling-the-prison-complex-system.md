Unraveling the Prison Complex System:

Case Study Cobb County, Georgia

Case \#16-1-5754-52

It is widely known that the systems at play are comprised of an elite that run our systems that keep the wealthy rich, and the disenfranchised, indigents, minorities, disabled or otherwise disadavantaged groups in the notoriously known "prison complex system".

But, how is it that this system hasn't been unhinged? Where are the roots of the system, and how can we begin to unveil its problems?

I came across this problem, this answer and this "complex" in my own life, and that is how all of this unfolds.

I am a happy working single mom, writer, creative and Latina living with PTSD, just outside the Metro Atlanta area, in the suburbs of Cobb County, Georgia.

I had suffered a series of traumatizing events in my house, working on a story about how Women of Color could, potentially, completely change the Vote. I started writing it, on this platform, celebrating equality, our feminist spirits, women of color of all sexual orientation, the x factor, an all inclusive magazine. The time and year, not so suprising, before primary elections in a highly contentions political arena, and one in which racism and sexism where center stage in the Spring of 2016\.

And just like that, is when my own personal Hell broke lose.

Internet went down, alarm going of, I was drugged and abused in my own home. Almost the perfect crime... except for one thing. It all led to my losing my house, my life, my child to the corruption of the Cobb County Superior Court system.

How this happened, in not quite sure but the reasons why aren't that far fetched.

I lived in a house that had a large reserve behind it. Wide open woods, with access from various areas in which, after taking a few hikes wondering out on my own, I found could be accessible to nearly anyone that so had the wish or will to do so. Public property, no restrictions of access.

I lost my shit. I had a nervous breakdown as all these events began to happen, leading me straight down the narrow path of the Cobb County Courts -- in defense of my basic human rights, as it now is clearly presented.

I was summoned in to court, with less than 24 hour notice, in a ill comprised summons package, no complaint, no petition, no real understanding of what the fuck what going on.

I'm hastily shoved into a Court room, Judge Stoddard preciding. Everyone was nice, cool, no feeling of conflict, except my own interruptions and pleas for counsel, so that I could " do whats best for my son".

The Judge wanted me to sign an order, giving custody to my ex of my child, at which time, in a complete neurosis of my own, I pled only for legal representation about 4 times that I can recall. No, no, my pleas ignored. The Judge said in order for my son to stay at my ex's house, in which I didn't want my child to be at, I would have to sign my son away to a man, which I now had started just to understand, was sexually abusive with my child. My little boy was only eight years old, and I completely unknowing of what to do. I had my job security taken from me, by my own family, terrorized at my house, and now facing the loss of my child.

It wasn't until a few months later that I discovered the original petition, in the form of a complaint, that the Court had considered for the initial Emergency Hearing. No petition for Legitimization, no actual notice of what matter of the hearing were for. It was a preposterous bag of bullshit, wild accusations that amounted to absoloutely nothing but repetitive, slanderous allegations from my ex.

Now, not only is a Legitimization not supposed to be in an Emergency Hearing, as my summons would have it, but all issues of custoy should be in a separate hearing, applying only their own Rules for Legitimazation that they have in Cobb County.

As a disabled, as indigent, and as a minor, my son and I both have been hugely neglected our rights to an attorney in such a hearing. It should have run concurrent to Juvenial court, safeguarding my child's welfare, allowing for CASA to be accesible (public program for these mattters), counsel, and oversight. OCGA 15 -- all of it was neglected. Juvenile laws.

But wait, there's more.

Rules of Evidence? None in play. Inadmissable hearsay, slander and libel, at best, is what they had, none of which was ever presented to me.

Due process? What's that? None afforded to me.

Infucciency of process, improper venue, lack of jurisdictional subject matter.

_Every single Constitutional Right,_

_Civil Right,_

_Human and Ethic rights,_

stand before me and not with me, in Civil

Case \# 16-1-5754-52

Cobb County Superior Court of Georgia

Five days after this preposterous hearing, I was found in so-called "Contempt", for picking my son up from school. Even if, we were to argue that the initial order even had a leg to stand on, the Contempt hearing should have been given to me with a 30 day notice, and there was no contempt, as I still had, under the Courts eyes, joint legal custody of my child. So why was I in contempt? Why was I detained at the airport, in the arrivals area, waiting for my friend, in federal jurisdiction two counties away? That explanation was never given, and the Courts of Cobb County felt somehow, that they didn't owe me one.

I was handcuffed, they made my child turnaround and watch. I pled for them to explain to me, why?, I warned them of my Miranda Rights. They were two men, at least 250 lbs., 6'4" -- they picked me up with my feet dangling in the air, injuring my shoulder, dislocating it at the rotator cuff.

The day was August, but the dates don't add up. The first day of school that year was August 1\. The hearing was scheduled for August 2, as the summons arrived only that afternoon, the first day of school. I remember clearly, it was an arduous day, my son at my ex's and he was alienating my child, and my mother helping in all of this, helping my ex take my son away? It's like a sick joke, one which I wouldn't even wish on my worse enemy, yet alone a child of mine? Evil mother, evil ex, evil Court system. As I sit looking pretty on this amazing platform I built on my own, everyone questioning my integrity? What for? Where's the fruit of your work? Let's play. What have you to show for yourself? Nada. Me? Everything! But, I digress.

Arrivng at the Sheriff's of Cobb County, I was shoved in to solitary confinement. 36 hours later, I was given only threats if I didn't take a vaccine shot, one which I told the nurse was against my religious beliefs, to which she responded- she would put me back in the cell without being processed, and not in the sytem.... Did I want that? Vaccine, or solitary confinement? I had to pick my evil, which one? I was pleading..._why_ am I here? Miranda Rights? My right to an attorney?

I warned you, assholes.

Now you know, and I told you that you have not afforded me my rights, and I told every single motherfucker in there. They laughed at me, calling me Alicia Silverstone? Yea, well fuck you too, assholes. I warned you, you fucked with the wrong bitch.

But my case docket is confusing. The contempt or order is filed as consent order, the dates make no sense, somewhere in there it implies I was IN jail, IN custody, when the custody, not contempt hearing was set. I'm so confused, and the more the cover-up the more they just show their corruptions.

Now where was I. Ah, yes. Was it a TB shot or tetanus shot? One of the two, it stung, I complained, the nurse threatened me with more isolation in the cell.

I was delayed again for my lack of answering all their questions, but not once did they answer mine. Why am I here? My Miranda Rights? If I'm in handcuffs in jail, then I have a right to an attorney. How dare you treat me like a criminal but afford me no rights, treating the case like a civil case. But still, any residual rights, parental rights, or any matter where a minor child's rights are "substancially affected", a Guardian At Litem is always appointed. In a hearing before Judge Poole on December 1st, I requested a GAL.

> "Not at this Court's expense"... "Do you have $3,500?" 

He looks at me, and then Dennis. To which we both responded no.

Judge Poole said he was treating this like a "divorce case". When I asked_why_ the contempt order, why was I having to defend myself for my basic rights? His response, to which I will never forget.

> "That ship has sailed"

What ship? It's the same case file?! I'm baffled, there looking at him as if the only person with one shred of understanding was me, that the injustice was so profuse, so obvious, that he didn't allow me Christmas with my child. No card, no call, no gift. There was no restraining order at that time, just some illogical no contact order in a contempt hearing, filed under Custody hearing. Yes, that's how confusing the issue is, that's how much they simply keep the powers at play, the disenfranchised weak. Little did he, nor they know, what a mother's will is, what one single girl can do. They underestimated what I would do, in order to establish one thing and one thing only. Justice.

Now, looking at my notes, the papers from jail said it was August 9th, but the date was August 13th and the contempt order (consent to them?) shows October 4, 2016\. The hearing transaction records shows incorrect information and illegal process.

8/1/2016 Kreeger shows "No service" "OFF".

8/2/2016 Kreeger shows "Consent" order (not contempt)

8/12/2016 Stoddars shows "Order granted" "Father has sole custody"

This is the mess I'm faced with. None of that is how it happened!

I tried on several attempt to show my "diagnosis, treatment and treatment plan" with "clear and convincing", or "clear and compelling evidence" was it? Either way, it left it soley at the judge's discretion, to which, presenting to them a CLEAR case (to the average person) of diagnosis, treatment and treatment plan. PTSD was clearly present, and the only reason I was in distress was due to the Court's order, the last time I submitted anything. That was ignored, again. My rights to see my child keep getting pushed aside, and my case now, not being heard. In other words, the reason my mental health was in question _was_ due to the fact of what they were doing to my son and I.

So I had to do what I had to do.

I answered, and complained, of course, last time I checked the document is not visable on the docket, it's the last document entered in. April 24, 2017

Judges should have:

* Compelled Discovery
* Notified nature of hearing bearing protective order
* Run concurrent to Juvenile Court
* Given my child a GAL
* Given me a right to confront testimony
* Produced testimony to me
* Right to contest
* If order was given in which no response was given within 30 days, then a copy of said interrogatory, should be quoted verbatim. But there was no interrogatory.
* Finding of facts and any evidence relied upon to make determination
* Right to cross-examine
* Court shall "state facts" upon which the continued custody is based
* Set a comprehensive plan
* Reserved any matter of custody for hearing seperate from Legitmization
* No Legitimization packed, no petition
* Set time frame within legal parameters under Juvenile courts
* Provided indigent and disabled rightsI was denied
* Due process
* Proper service
* Proper notification
* Denied access to facts which impacted my fundamental rights
* Denied proper plan
* Denied remedy

There's "no complaint in which relief can be sought". The law of the Land

Judges had:

Lack of jurisdictional powers, in subject matter, in hearing which modified and order, in federal airport jurisdiction, by motions and orders incorrectly and grossly abusive.

Conflict of interest, why was I being heard with a drug court Judge? Alternative courts, they get $9,000, so they NEEDED me to be in the alternative court, and keeping me IN drug court is what they needed... where's this so-called "evidence" that drugs was an issue? I showed my medication prescription, I went an received a second opinion in the Court's same agency they refer people to, and had the same presciption prescribed, after my third assesment, treatment plan and treatment. Mind you, the last being a Court agency. I had to make sure no stone went unturned.

Civil Court Procedure Rules

Rule 5.5 Privilage of information, witheld. Material prejudice, rather.

Rule 6.2 Reply, unless otherwise ordered (which it was not), therefore a Contempt was given preemptively.

Rule 6.3 All motions shall be decided by oral hearing EXCEPT motions not withstanding verdict. So if we apply this, then why do I have to present evidence? But this matter should have been in writing, as stipulated in its' own rules.

Rule 6.4 Failure to make discovery and Motion to Compel Discovery

OCGA 9.11.37

(A)(i) Quote verbatim or copy AS AN EXHIBIT each interrogatory to which no response or insufficiency of reponse is provided.

Letters, improperly entered, inadmissable and slanderous, nor provided to Defendant were used as "instruments of authenticy and guarantee of facts"

Ruling were made on judges right to informal adjutication, might be argued. But facts show that there were clear laws that "precluded the judge's decisions", therefore the rulings do not stand, nor are they even admissable.

Did I mention that Judge Brantley, one of the Judges, the one I petitioned for an Emergency Hearing and saw with my letter stating my case, just ordered a restraining order against me and my son? That's where we are. Restaining order given to Dennis Brown, against Vanessa Smith, allowing my son to be in that beasts hands.

Once I started digging into the Cobb County docket, I searched under pro se motions. I started unraveling the truth.

Case after case, indigent, imprisoned, maternal and otherwise the most vulnerable, were time and time again dealt the same hand. Orders being given when in jail, on failure of apperance. The irony, the gross abuse. The atrocities.

Cases where the inmate was petitioned for Habeas Corpus, a plee of desperate help one uses. But the law, the rules, state that the warden, the same warden in which complaints were being filed against, were the ones that had to take down the complaint, and file on their behalf. I found cases where petitions dismissed, for lack of proper entry, failure of appearance, or some sort of administrative bullshit, bullshit the Court didn't follow, but followed the strictest of guidlines for inmates? Orders being entered while in detention.

Davis v Stangers Executor

_"where influence is acquired and abused, or where confidence is reposed and betrayed"_

Every day an inmate is incarcerated, they profit. The Judges profit from incarceration.

Now, let's discuss term limits. Term limits on Judges "not until they retire, IMPEACHED or death."

Is there a reason I've been fearful, would you say?

Upon reviewing the _Civil Court on Salaries_ law, I discovered amazing things.

Incumbents must run consecutive terms or all salaries of Judges are affected. What's the salary MANDATED by OCGA? $169,000, and $189,900 for Senior Judges. We get a bonus for alternative courts
