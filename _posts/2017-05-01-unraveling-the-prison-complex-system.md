Unraveling the Prison Complex System:

Case Study Cobb County, Georgia

It is widely known that the systems at play are comprised of an elite that run our systems that keep the wealthy rich, and the disenfranchised, indigents, minorities, disabled or otherwise disadavantaged groups in a, notoriously known, "prison complex system".

But, how is it that this system hasn't been unhinged? Where are the roots of the system, and how can we begin to unveil its problems?

I came across this problem, this answer and this "complex" in my own life, and that is how all of this unfolds.

I am a happy working single mom, writer, creative and Latina living with PTSD, just outside the Metro Atlanta area, in the suburbs of Cobb County, Georgia.

I had suffered a series of traumatizing events in my house, working on a story about how Women of Color could, potentially, completely change the Vote. The time and year, not so suprising, before primary elections in a highly contentions political arena, and one in which racism and sexism where center stage in the Spring of 2016\. 

And just like that, is when my own personal Hell broke lose.

Internet went down, alarm going of, I was drugged and abused in my own home. Almost the perfect crime... except for one thing. It all led to my losing my house, my life, my child to the corruption of the Cobb County Superior Court system.

How this happened, well, reasons why aren't that far fetched.

I lived in a house that had a large reserve behind it. Wide open woods, with access from various areas in which, after taking a few hikes wondering out on my own, I found could be accessible to nearly anyone that so had the wish or will to do so. Public property, no restrictions of access.

I lost my shit. I had a nervous breakdown as all these events began to happen, leading me straight down the narrow path of the Cobb County Courts -- in defense of my basic human rights, as it now is clearly presented.

I was summoned in to court, with less than 24 hour notice, in a ill comprised summons package, no complaint, no petition, no real understanding of what the fuck what going on.

I'm hastily shoved into a Court room, Judge Stoddard preciding. Everyone was nice, cool, no feeling of conflict, except my own interruptions and pleas for counsel, so that I could " do whats best for my son".

The Judge wanted me to sign an order, giving custody to my ex of my child, at which time, in a complete neurosis of my own, I pled only for legal representation about 4 times that I can recall. No, no, my pleas ignored. The Judge said in order for my son to stay at my ex's house, in which I didn't want my child to be at, I would have to sign my son away to a man, which I now had started just to understand, was sexually abusive with my child. My little boy was only eight years old, and I completely unknowing of what to do. I had my job security taken from my family, terrorized at my house, and now facing the loss of my child.

It wasn't until a few months later that I discovered the original petition, in the form of a complaint, that the Court had considired for the initial Emergency Hearing. No petition for Legitimization, no actual notice of what matter of the hearing were for.

Now, not only is a Legitimization not supposed to be in an Emergency Hearing, as my summons would have it, but all issues of custoy should be in a separate hearing, as the current Rules for Legitimazation have in Cobb County. 

As a disabled, as indigent, and as a minor, my son and I both have been hugely neglected our rights to an attorney in such a hearing. It should have run concurrent to Juveniel court, safeguarding my child's welfare, allowing for CASA to be accesible (public program for these mattters), counsel, and oversight. OCGA 15 -- all of it was neglected. Juvenile laws.

But wait, there's more.

Rules of Evidence? None in play. Inadmissable hearsay, slander and libel, at best, is what they had, none of which was ever presented to me. 

Due process? What's that? None afforded to me.

Infucciency of process, improper venue, every single fundamental right stripped of me. Lack of jurisdictional subject matter, every Constitutional Right, Civil Right, Human and Ethic rights, stand before me and not with me, in civl Case \# 16-1-5754-52\.

Five days after this preposterous hearing, I was found in so-called "Contempt", for picking my son up from school. Even if, we were to argue that the initial order even had a leg to stand on, the Contempt hearing should have been given to me with a 30 day notice, and there was no contempt, as I still had, under the Courts eyes, joing legal custody of my child. So why was I in contempt? Why was I detained at the airport, in the arrivals area, waiting for my friend, in federal jurisdiction two counties away?

I was handcuffed, they made my child turnaround and watch. I pled for them to explain to me, why?, I warned them of my Miranda Rights. They were two men, at least 250 lbs., 6'4" -- they picked me up with my feet dangling in the air, injuring my shoulder, dislocating it at the rotator cuff.

Arrivng at the Sheriff's of Cobb County, I was shoved in to solitary confinement. Given only threats if I didn't take a vaccine shot, one which I told the nurse was against my religious beliefs, to which she responded- she would put me back in the cell without being processed, and not in the sytem.... Did I want that? Vaccine, or solitary confinement? I had to pick my evil, which one?

But my case docket is confusing. The contempt or order is filed as consent order, the dates make no sense, somewhere in there it implies I was IN jail, IN custody, when the custody, not contempt hearing was set. I'm so confused, and the more the cover-up the more they just show their corruptions.
