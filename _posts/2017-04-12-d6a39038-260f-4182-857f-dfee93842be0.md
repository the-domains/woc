The New American Economy, sent an Open Letter signed by Laureates, economists, business and political figures, all whom are in favor of a pro-immigration reform that is so desperately needed.

Addressed : "Dear Mr. President, Majority Leader McConnell, Minority Leader Schumer, Speaker Ryan, and Minority Leader Pelosi," the letter urges Congress and the Administration that the issues at stake are "universal issues", purposely thwarting away ideological issues on market and government, so as to come to a consensus on those issues which are central to our economic prosperity.

Advisers and economists echoed the sentiment of the economic implications of our immigration system, showcasing the "myriad" that is immigration. According to the letter, those "benefits" include:

• Immigration brings entrepreneurs who start new businesses that hire American workers. • Immigration brings young workers who help offset the large-scale retirement of baby boomers. • Immigration brings diverse skill sets that keep our workforce flexible, help companies grow, and increase the productivity of American workers. • Immigrants are far more likely to work in innovative, job-creating fields such as science, technology, engineering,, and math that create life-improving products and drive economic growth.

The NAE is centered around the 15 main economic issues of immigration reform, addressing immigrant workforce through driving principles such as pathway to citizenship, work visa programs, with safety and security systems, while working towards stabilizing our broken immigration system.
